						What is a Geomagnetic Storm?
					</h2>
					<p class="para-line" >
						A geomagnetic storm is a major disturbance of Earth's magnetosphere that occurs when there is a very efficient exchange of energy from the solar wind into the space environment surrounding Earth.
(Solar wind: The solar wind is a continual stream of protons and electrons from the sun's outermost atmosphere — the corona. These charged particles breeze through the solar system at speeds ranging from around 250 miles (400 kilometers) per second to 500 miles (800 km) per second, in a plasma state.) The largest storms that result from these conditions are associated with solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) where a billion tons or so of plasma from the sun, with its embedded magnetic field, arrives at Earth. CMEs typically take several days to arrive at Earth, but have been observed, for some of the most intense storms, to arrive in as short as 18 hours.

                            A Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) is a massive burst of solar wind and magnetic fields rising above the solar corona or being released into space. These eruptions of solar material can contain charged particles, such as electrons and protons, and can have a significant impact on space weather and the Earth's magnetosphere when they intersect with our planet.

							What is the Dst index and Planetary K index?
                        </h2>
                        <p class="para-line" >
							Dst index and Planetary K index (also known as Kp index) are two ways to measure the level of a geomagnetic storm
							For Dst index it measure how much the solar flare is weakening the Earth’s magnetic field so the values are certainly negative a weak storm has −30 nT > Dst > −50 nT, a moderate storm has −50 nT > Dst > −100 nT, a strong storm has −100 nT > Dst > −200 nT, a severe storm has −200 nT > Dst > −350 nT, and a great storm has Dst < 350 nT. (nT represents nanotesla)
							For the Kp index it describes the disturbance of the Earth's magnetic field caused by the solar wind. The faster the solar wind blows, the greater the turbulence. The index ranges from 0, for low activity, to 9, which means that an intense geomagnetic storm is under way.
							Kp index values of 0 to 1 represent very quiet geomagnetic conditions, indicating minimal or no disturbances.
							Values between 2 and 3 signify slightly disturbed conditions, which are generally considered normal.
							Values of 4 or 5 indicate active geomagnetic conditions, which may affect high-latitude power systems and satellite operations.
							When the Kp index reaches 6 or higher, it signifies a geomagnetic storm. These storms can lead to significant disruptions in power grids, satellite communication, and navigation systems.
							Extremely high values, such as 8 or 9, represent severe geomagnetic storms that can have widespread and severe impacts on technology and infrastructure.
							
							The "Bt" value represents the magnitude of the magnetic field vector of the solar wind. It is typically expressed in units of nanoteslas (nT), which is a standard unit of magnetic field strength.
							Variation: The "Bt" value can vary widely depending on solar activity. During periods of heightened solar activity, such as when the Sun is in its active phase of the solar cycle, the "Bt" value can be elevated, indicating stronger and more dynamic solar wind conditions. This can lead to more significant geomagnetic disturbances when the solar wind interacts with Earth.
							Geomagnetic Storm Impact: High "Bt" values are often associated with more intense geomagnetic storms. These storms can disrupt satellite communications, GPS systems, power grids, and even lead to beautiful auroras (Northern and Southern Lights). Therefore, monitoring the "Bt" value is crucial for assessing the potential impact of geomagnetic storms on technology and infrastructure.

								What satellites measure the Solar Wind Activity?
							</h2>
							<p class="para-line" >
								The DSCOVR mission succeeded NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer's (ACE) role in supporting solar wind alerts and warnings from the L1 orbit, which is the neutral gravity point between the Earth and Sun, approximately one million miles from Earth. L1 is a good position from which to monitor the Sun, because the constant stream of particles from the Sun (the solar wind) reaches L1 up to an hour before reaching Earth.
								From this position, DSCOVR can typically provide 15- to 60-minute advanced warning before a storm of particles and magnetic field, known as a coronal mass ejection (or CME), reaches Earth. DSCOVR data also helps improve predictions of geomagnetic storm impact locations. Our national security and economic well-being, which depend on advanced technologies, are at risk without these advanced warnings.
							   DSCOVR satellite is experiencing some anomalies in its plasma system (measuring density, temperature and speed of solar wind) due to its long time working (it was planned tobe a 5 years mission from 2015, and now its been working for 8 years)
							   Therefore the DSCOVR satellite is still measuring accurate data in its magnetic field system (predicting the vectors of Bt and Bz value).

								What is the Bz, Bx and By value?
							</h2>
							<p class="para-line" >
								The "Bx," "By," and "Bz" values are components of the magnetic field within the solar wind. These components describe the orientation and strength of the magnetic field carried by the solar wind, and they play a crucial role in understanding how the solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetosphere and can lead to geomagnetic activity. Here's what each of these values represents
								The most important component to predict geomagnetic storm is the Bz
								Let us define each one:
								Bx (North-South Component):
								Bx represents the north-south component of the magnetic field within the solar wind.
								A positive Bx value indicates that the magnetic field is pointing northward, away from the Sun.
								A negative Bx value indicates that the magnetic field is pointing southward, toward the Sun.
								The Bx component is often used to determine how well-aligned the solar wind's magnetic field is with Earth's magnetic field, which can affect the intensity of geomagnetic disturbances.
								By (East-West Component):
								
								By represents the east-west component of the magnetic field within the solar wind.
								A positive By value indicates that the magnetic field points eastward.
								A negative By value indicates that the magnetic field points westward.
								The By component is essential for assessing the potential for geomagnetic storm development, as variations in this component can influence the reconnection of magnetic fields during solar wind-magnetosphere interactions.
								
								Bz (Vertical or Up-Down Component):
								
								Bz represents the vertical or up-down component of the magnetic field within the solar wind.
								A positive Bz value indicates that the magnetic field points upward, out of the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun.
								A negative Bz value indicates that the magnetic field points downward, into the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun.
								The Bz component is particularly critical for determining the potential impact of the solar

							The sun’s cycle effect on geomagnetic storm:
						</h2>
						<p class="para-line" >
							<strong>How can the sun cycle influence geomagnetic storms?</strong> <br>
		The sun goes through a natural solar cycle approximately every 11 years. The cycle is marked by the increase and decrease of sunspots -- visible as dark blemishes on the sun's surface, or photosphere. The greatest number of sunspots in any given solar cycle is designated as "solar maximum." The lowest number is "solar minimum."
	The solar cycle provides more than just increased sunspots, however. In the sun's atmosphere, or corona, bright active regions appear, which are rooted in the lower sunspots. Scientists track the active regions since they are often the origin of eruptions on the sun such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections.The middle of the solar cycle is the solar maximum, or when the Sun has the most sunspots. As the cycle ends, it fades back to the solar minimum and then a new cycle begins. Giant eruptions on the Sun, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, also increase during the solar cycle.
	Several studies have explored and quantified the relation between storms, and have found that generally the magnitude and number of geomagnetic storms that occurred during a given SC increase as the number of sunspots increases, reaching its greatest value during descending phase, 2 or 3 yr after the maximum phase of each cycle

								The Carrington event :
							</h2>
							<p class="para-line" >
								The Carrington Event was the most intense geomagnetic storm in recorded history, peaking from 1 to 2 September 1859 during solar cycle 10. It created strong auroral displays that were reported globally,and caused sparking and even fires in multiple telegraph stations. The geomagnetic storm was most likely the result of a coronal mass ejection (CME) from the Sun colliding with Earth's magnetosphere.
								The geomagnetic storm was associated with a very bright solar flare on 1 September 1859.
								On 1–2 September 1859, one of the largest geomagnetic storms (as recorded by ground-based magnetometers) occurred. The geomagnetic storm is thought to have been initiated by a major CME that traveled directly toward Earth, taking 17.6 hours to make the 150-million-kilometre journey ( normally CME take a few days to reach earth) . Auroras were seen around the world in both northern and southern hemispheres. The aurora over the Rocky Mountains in the United States was so bright that the glow woke gold miners, who began preparing breakfast because they thought it was morning. A geomagnetic storm of this magnitude occurring today would cause widespread electrical disruptions, blackouts, and damage due to extended outages of the electrical power grid. Power grids, phone and wifi cables may be permanently damaged causing a massive shutdown to diverse areas all over the world, countries with mediocre to no technological advancements will suffer the most. If something similar were to happen today, all the technological systems we depend on would be in complete disorder. A Carrington-magnitude event would kill millions, and cause trillions of dollars in damage. The intense radiation, ionized particles would all hurl towards the earth ravaging everything in its path.
